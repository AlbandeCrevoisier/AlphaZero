Reimplementation of DeepMind's Alpha Zero.

To adapt to our resources, we downscaled the project as follows:
- 5x5 goban
- 256 filters instead of 256 (TO UPDATE WHEN CHANGED)
- 2 residual blocks instead of 19

We also simplified the job system, as we do not use it.

Files:
model.py - generate the keras model of the architecture
mcts.py - Monte-Carlo Tree Search
